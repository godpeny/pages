## Concept
![alt text](images/blog29_mcp_concept.png)

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools. 

 - MCP Hosts: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
 -MCP Clients: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
 - MCP Servers: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
 - Local Data Sources: Your computerâ€™s files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
- Remote Services: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to
