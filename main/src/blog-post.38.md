# Clustering
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique designed to group unlabeled examples based on their similarity to each other. 
If the examples are labeled, this kind of grouping is called "classification".

As you can see  the data forms three clusters, even without a formal definition of similarity between data points. In real-world applications, however, you need to explicitly define a similarity measure, or the metric used to compare samples, in terms of the dataset's features. As the number of features increases, combining and comparing features becomes less intuitive and more complex.

After clustering, each group is assigned a unique label called a cluster ID. Clustering is powerful because it can simplify large, complex datasets with many features to a single cluster ID.
