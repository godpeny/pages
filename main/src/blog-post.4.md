# Sequence Model and Attention Mechanism
## Preliminaries
### Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
SMT is a type of machine translation that uses statistical models to translate text from one language to another. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, SMT relies on large bilingual text corpora to build probabilistic models that determine the likelihood of a sentence in the target language given a sentence in the source language.  
This approach marked a significant shift in natural language processing (NLP) and more advanced machine translation technologies.
